<h1>CSIT Notice Scraper</h1>
This repository contains a Node.js-based web scraper that checks for new CSIT-related notices published on the IOST website and sends them to a Discord channel via a webhook. The scraper runs automatically every hour and checks for new notices containing the keywords "CSIT" and "2079". If new notices are found, they are sent to a designated Discord channel.
